The multi-process galaxy-ng image is now named `galaxy` instead of `pulp-galaxy-ng`. `pulp-galaxy-ng` will not be published anymore, use `galaxy` instead. The single-process `galaxy-minimal` image is now no longer also published as `galaxy`, use `galaxy-minimal` if you want a smaller image that only functions as single-process. Also, the multi-process galaxy-ng image now has a `latest` tag in addition to its `stable` tag.
